Ideally, it would include a license inside the file. (Ideally, that would be a license that raises no questions in a corporate environment.) –

Also, this should have .vs/, see here: stackoverflow.com/a/31879242/1143274 –

@EvgeniSergeev running the tool at 2023 produces also .vs/ option –

Disagree with *.resharper. Files matching *.ReSharper.user should be ignored, but that's catered for by the *.user rule above. –

@DrewNoakes: What are the ReSharper files that you believe should be revision controlled? –

@PerLundberg One reason worth considering is you can configure standard project formatting options, etc, and save the config files with the project. If this is in git, it makes it easier for everyone using Resharper to keep the project formatted consistently. –

For those interested in what Microsoft thinks should be included in the gitignore, here's the default one which Visual Studio 2013 RTM automatically generates when creating a new Git-Repository:

## Ignore Visual Studio temporary files, build results, and
## files generated by popular Visual Studio add-ons.

# User-specific files
*.suo
*.user
*.sln.docstates

# Build results

[Dd]ebug/
[Rr]elease/
x64/
build/
[Bb]in/
[Oo]bj/

# Enable "build/" folder in the NuGet Packages folder since NuGet packages use it for MSBuild targets
!packages/*/build/
